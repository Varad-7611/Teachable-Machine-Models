# 🤖 Image Classification with Teachable Machine (Google)

This project demonstrates how to use **Google’s Teachable Machine** to build and deploy an **image classification model** — no coding required for training!

The model is trained using Google's intuitive web-based interface and then integrated into a custom application using the exported files. It's a great way to explore **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **real-time image prediction**.
